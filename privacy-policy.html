            <p>
                This privacy policy ("Policy") describes how the personally identifiable information ("Personal
                Information") that you may provide to access or use the applications ("Applications" or "Service") and
                games provided by <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Supreme+Soft">Supreme
                    Soft</a>, and any of its related products and services (collectively, "Services") is collected,
                protected, and used. It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your Personal
                Information and how you can access and update this information. This Policy is a legally binding
                agreement between you ("User", "you" or "your") and this Application developer ("Operator", "we", "us"
                or "our"). By accessing and using the Website, Application(s), games, and Services, you acknowledge that
                you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. This Policy does not
                apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control, or to individuals that we do not
                employ or manage.

            </p>
            <h2>Automatic collection of information</h2>
            <p>
                When you open the Website or Application(s) or games, our servers automatically record information that
                your browser sends. This data may include information such as your device's IP address, browser type and
                version, operating system type and version, language preferences, or the webpage you were visiting
                before you came to the Website, Applications, or Services, pages of the Website, Applications, or
                Services that you visit, the time spent on those pages, information you search for on the Website,
                access times and dates, and other statistics.
            </p>
            <p>
                Information collected automatically is used only to identify potential cases of abuse and establish
                statistical information regarding the usage and traffic of the Website and Services. This statistical
                information is not otherwise aggregated in such a way that would identify any particular user of the
                system.
            </p>
            <h2>Collection of personal information</h2>
            <p>
                You can access and use the Website, Applications, and games without telling us who you are or revealing
                any information by which someone could identify you as a specific, identifiable individual. If, however,
                you wish to use some of the features on the Website, Applications, or games, you may be asked to provide
                certain Personal Information (for example, your name and e-mail address). We receive and store any
                information you knowingly provide to us when you publish content or fill any online forms on the
                Website, Applications, or games. When required, this information may include the following:
            </p>
            <ul class="info">
                <li>Personal details such as name, country of residence, etc.</li>
                <li>Contact information such as email address, address, etc.</li>
                <li>Account details such as user name, unique user ID, password, etc.</li>
                <li>Geolocation data such as latitude and longitude.</li>
                <li>Any other materials you willingly submit to us such as articles, images, feedback, etc.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Some of the information we collect is directly from you via the Website, Applications, and games.
                However, we may also collect Personal Information about you from other sources such as public databases
                and our joint marketing partners. You can choose not to provide us with your Personal Information, but
                then you may not be able to take advantage of some of the features on the Website, Applications, or
                games. Users who are uncertain about what information is mandatory are welcome to contact us.
            </p>
            <h2>Use and processing of collected information</h2>
            <p>In order to make the Website, Applications, and games available to you, or to meet a legal obligation, we
                need to collect and use certain Personal Information. If you do not provide the information that we
                request, we may not be able to provide you with the requested products or services. Any of the
                information we collect from you may be used for the following purposes:
            </p>
            <ul class="info">
                <li>Respond to inquiries and offer support</li>
                <li>Request user feedback</li>
                <li>Improve user experience</li>
                <li>Run and operate the Website and Services</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Processing your Personal Information depends on how you interact with the Website, Applications, and
                games, where you are located in the world, and if one of the following applies: (i) you have given your
                consent for one or more specific purposes; this, however, does not apply whenever the processing of
                Personal Information is subject to European data protection law; (ii) provision of information is
                necessary for the performance of an agreement with you and/or for any pre-contractual obligations
                thereof; (iii) processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which you are subject;
                (iv) processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of
                official authority vested in us; (v) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate
                interests pursued by us or by a third party.
            </p>
            <p>Note that under some legislations we may be allowed to process information until you object to such
                processing (by opting out), without having to rely on consent or any other of the following legal bases
                below. In any case, we will be happy to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the processing,
                and in particular whether the provision of Personal Information is a statutory or contractual
                requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.</p>
            <h2>Disclosure of information</h2>
            <p>Depending on the requested Services or as necessary to complete any transaction or provide any service
                you have requested, we may share your information with your consent with our trusted third parties that
                work with us, any other affiliates and subsidiaries we rely upon to assist in the operation of the
                Website and Services available to you. We do not share Personal Information with unaffiliated third
                parties. These service providers are not authorized to use or disclose your information except as
                necessary to perform services on our behalf or comply with legal requirements. We may share your
                Personal Information for these purposes only with third parties whose privacy policies are consistent
                with ours or who agree to abide by our policies with respect to Personal Information. These third
                parties are given Personal Information they need only in order to perform their designated functions,
                and we do not authorize them to use or disclose Personal Information for their own marketing or other
                purposes.</p>
            <p>We will disclose any Personal Information we collect, use or receive if required or permitted by law,
                such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process, and when we believe in good faith that
                disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate
                fraud, or respond to a government request.</p>
            <h2>Retention of information</h2>
            <p>We will retain and use your Personal Information for the period necessary to comply with our legal
                obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements unless a longer retention period is required
                or permitted by law. We may use any aggregated data derived from or incorporating your Personal
                Information after you update or delete it, but not in a manner that would identify you personally. Once
                the retention period expires, Personal Information shall be deleted. Therefore, the right to access, the
                right to erasure, the right to rectification and the right to data portability cannot be enforced after
                the expiration of the retention period.</p>
            <h2>The rights of users</h2>
            <p>You may exercise certain rights regarding your information processed by us. In particular, you have the
                right to do the following: (i) you have the right to withdraw consent where you have previously given
                your consent to the processing of your information; (ii) you have the right to object to the processing
                of your information if the processing is carried out on a legal basis other than consent; (iii) you have
                the right to learn if information is being processed by us, obtain disclosure regarding certain aspects
                of the processing and obtain a copy of the information undergoing processing; (iv) you have the right to
                verify the accuracy of your information and ask for it to be updated or corrected; (v) you have the
                right, under certain circumstances, to restrict the processing of your information, in which case, we
                will not process your information for any purpose other than storing it; (vi) you have the right, under
                certain circumstances, to obtain the erasure of your Personal Information from us; (vii) you have the
                right to receive your information in a structured, commonly used and machine readable format and, if
                technically feasible, to have it transmitted to another controller without any hindrance. This provision
                is applicable provided that your information is processed by automated means and that the processing is
                based on your consent, on a contract which you are part of or on pre-contractual obligations thereof.
            </p>
            <h2>Privacy of children</h2>
            <p>We do not knowingly collect any Personal Information from children under the age of 18. If you are under
                the age of 18, please do not submit any Personal Information through the Website, Applications, and
                games. We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children's Internet usage and to help
                enforce this Policy by instructing their children never to provide Personal Information through the
                Website, Applications, and games without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child
                under the age of 18 has provided Personal Information to us through the Website, Applications, and
                games, please contact us. You must also be old enough to consent to the processing of your Personal
                Information in your country (in some countries, we may allow your parent or guardian to do so on your
                behalf).
            </p>
            <h2>Cookies</h2>
            <p>The Website, Applications, and games use &quot;cookies&quot; to help personalize your online experience.
                A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to
                run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you and can only be
                read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.
            </p>
            <p>We may use cookies to collect, store, and track information for statistical purposes to operate the
                Website, Applications, and games. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers
                automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you
                prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the features of the
                Website, Applications, and games. To learn more about cookies and how to manage them, visit <a

            </p>
            <h2>Do Not Track signals</h2>
            <p>Some browsers incorporate a Do Not Track feature that signals to websites you visit that you do not want
                to have your online activity tracked. Tracking is not the same as using or collecting information in
                connection with a website. For these purposes, tracking refers to collecting personally identifiable
                information from consumers who use or visit a website, app, or online service as they move across
                different websites over time. The Website, Applications, and games do not track their visitors over time
                and across third-party websites or applications. However, some third-party sites may keep track of your
                browsing activities when they serve you content, which enables them to tailor what they present to you.
            </p>
            <h2>Email marketing</h2>
            <p>We offer electronic newsletters to which you may voluntarily subscribe at any time. We are committed to
                keeping your e-mail address confidential and will not disclose your email address to any third parties
                except as allowed in the information use and processing section or for the purposes of utilizing a third
                party provider to send such emails. We will maintain the information sent via e-mail in accordance with
                applicable laws and regulations.</p>
            <p>In compliance with the CAN-SPAM Act, all e-mails sent from us will clearly state who the e-mail is from
                and provide clear information on how to contact the sender. You may choose to stop receiving our
                newsletter or marketing emails by following the unsubscribe instructions included in these emails or by
                contacting us.</p>
            <h2>Links to other resources</h2>
            <p>The Website, Applications, and games may contain links to other resources that are not owned or
                controlled by us. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other
                resources or third parties. We encourage you to be aware when you leave the Website, Applications, and
                games and to read the privacy statements of each and every resource that may collect Personal
                Information.
            </p>
            <h2>Information security</h2>
            <p>We secure information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from
                unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. We maintain reasonable administrative, technical, and physical
                safeguards in an effort to protect against unauthorized access, use, modification, and disclosure of
                Personal Information in its control and custody. However, no data transmission over the Internet or
                wireless network can be guaranteed. Therefore, while we strive to protect your Personal Information, you
                acknowledge that (i) there are security and privacy limitations of the Internet which are beyond our
                control; (ii) the security, integrity, and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between
                you and the Website, Applications, and games cannot be guaranteed; and (iii) any such information and
                data may be viewed or tampered with in transit by a third party, despite best efforts.
            </p>
            <h2>Data breach</h2>
            <p>In the event we become aware that the security of the Website, Applications, and games has been
                compromised or users' Personal Information has been disclosed to unrelated third parties as a result of
                external activity, including, but not limited to, security attacks or fraud, we reserve the right to
                take reasonably appropriate measures, including, but not limited to, investigation and reporting, as
                well as notification to and cooperation with law enforcement authorities. In the event of a data breach,
                we will make reasonable efforts to notify affected individuals if we believe that there is a reasonable
                risk of harm to the user as a result of the breach or if notice is otherwise required by law. When we
                do, we will post a notice on the Website or Applications.
            </p>
